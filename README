BUGS
================================================================================

I test this example on debian 32 and 64 bit and Mac OS X 10.9.1. During the
compilation you will find some warnings due to unused parameters given to the
callback.
Moreover on Mac, the library pthread is not used (due to clang but gcc need it).
